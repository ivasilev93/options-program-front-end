## Developer Note
### The frontend was built primarily to test and demo the protocol logic of the Options program. 
### While it works as intended and has a clean-enough UI, the codebase is not architected for scale or production

## Installation
```bash

git clone ...
cd options-program-front-end
npm install
npm run dev
```
